this does everything: preprocessing, BOLD correction of VASO, motion correction, layering etc. Mostly C++ with a bit of Matlab here and there

90% of it is in C++, 
very little bit in matlab/SPM

Most of the C++ evaluations uses a nii O/I from ODIN. Since it is a bit involved to install I use it in a virtual box.
